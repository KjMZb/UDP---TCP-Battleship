# UDP---TCP-Battleship

These Java classes were created to fulfill an assignment in Advanced Object Oriented Programming at Rochester Institute of Technology. This assingment called for UDP and TCP implementations of a two player game of battleship. 

Future work includes: Refining the classes that set up the game board; handlling  long wait times; and implementing a graphical user interface.
